        <p>Jordan Versluis is a veteran graphic designer in St. Catharines, Ontario. With considerable experience creating bespoke visual identity suites for clients across diverse industries, Jordan produces striking logo designs that are practical and adaptable across various contexts, both digital and print.</p>

        <img src="" alt="">

        <p>For his clients, Jordan’s precise communication style and collaborative approach mean an easy, engaging, and tailored experience.

        He incorporates client input at every stage of the process, and is adept at distilling rough ideas into refined, cohesive visual identities. His work includes thoughtful use of colour and symbolism that refer subtly to his clients’ stories and perspectives. 
        
        When combined with his clean, elegant style, this approach results in enduring designs that are beautiful, original, and say something truly meaningful about the brand.</p>
